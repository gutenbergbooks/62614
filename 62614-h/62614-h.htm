<span class="i0">The gate which led into the sacred place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hair was black as night, her eyes a deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of melancholy mystery and dreams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her chiselled features had the striking charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of youthful beauty and a mind mature;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was unlike the women of the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger whom the priest had never met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he espied her with a sense of fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sable garb and downcast mien betrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A state of grief, wherefore the kindly man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led by a heartfelt sympathy, did ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What great bereavement weighed upon her soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which she answered: “Sir, I sorrow not<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor elsewhere for the dead; but for this church<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sibyl whose renown had come to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore asked that she would further tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her vision of the things to be.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And when the rent shall grow sufficient wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be the hiding of a prayer book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the church sink down and be no more.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then quote the priest, with frown upon his face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The house built on a rock can never sink.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“But what is built on sand the floods destroy,”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Before the altar in an earnest prayer,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of his departed friend whose earthly life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been cut off in a most tragic way;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rich offerings&mdash;atonements for his deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sinfulness&mdash;outweighing charity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while he prayed, he seemed to hear the cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And groaning of the soul, from out the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of purgatory; supplications strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascended to the mercy-seat of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From humble altar-steps, until he felt,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Departing from the church, he looked about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that strange, mournful face; but she was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came a thought to him, a memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of something which the baron him had told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How on a summer’s day, while on a hunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He met a maiden in a forest glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slender girl of beauty, such as he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had seldom seen&mdash;of Oriental cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who weeping told him of his fate most dire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fire should him consume, a prophesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So terribly fulfilled, and now, perchance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very same had prophesied to him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This thought possessed his mind, as home he strode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dark forbodings of impending doom.<br /></span>
<span class="astc">* * * * * * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a Sunday, in the month of June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A morn of most bewitching summer-charms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air was charged with fragrance of the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blooming cherry trees, and glist’ning birch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mountain ash and tow’ring balsam trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hazel-wood and prickly juniper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of alder trees along the winding brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mountain forest of the pungent pine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thousand flowers in the meads and vales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An odor sweet&mdash;unknown to tropic clime.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within God’s acre stood the nodding rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In checkered sunlight, neath the cypress tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greeted every breeze that wandered by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groups of the peasant folk were gathering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the graves, in silent thoughtfulness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some in sorrow round the recent mounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air so calm and mild with fragrance filled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tolling of the church bells deep and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made this a day of sweet solemnity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt by the aged and the youth alike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while they lingered, lo, the sibyl came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From group to group a whisper passed with awe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It is the sibyl!” Slowly gathering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her, fearing what she might pronounce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gazed upon her pale and mournful face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“All is but vanity, all things are nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All flesh is grass, which flourisheth a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then withers, dies, and mingles with the dust,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like leaves upon the trees which now are green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And full of juice, but in the autumn turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sear and yellow, falling to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirled by the chilling blast into a heap,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus must ye return to dust some day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all your work must perish, even so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, even the church must perish on that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When crowns of mountain ash trees meet above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chancel roof, and when the wall receives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within its rent a common prayer book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the earth engulf it, and the pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of generations perish in the deep.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake the sibyl, and the fearful crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displeasure showed by mien and murmuring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, much perturbed, essayed to argue thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Thy words, O woman, are but idle talk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This church, built on such firm and rocky ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can never sink, such prophecy is vain;”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which she answered with a sigh subdued:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I’ve told you only what I’ve heard and seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In truest vision of the things to come.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These words were uttered as the last bell rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its summons to the Mass, obeyed at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all the people, leaving her alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while they prayed, she found a resting-place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the cooling shadow of the church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listened to a lark that soared on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the blue of heaven’s temple-dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the chorus ’mongst the sighing trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most of all did note the jack-daws cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That melancholy bird of occult hue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a trance she listened to them all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thousand voices of a summer’s day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere the Mass was ended rose and went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along a forest path her solitary way.<br /></span>
<span class="astc">* * * * * * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then after many years, upon a morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In early autumn, when the aspen trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were turning golden, and the starlings sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkling flocks from meadows shorn and sear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pastor took his much accustomed walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he did love to be alone and muse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the wondrous scenes around his home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feel great nature’s sweet and changing moods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although the years had turned his hair to grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And robbed his steps of elasticity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still was his spirit quite susceptible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To happiness, but more to sorrow’s touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on a day like this with feelings mixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sadness of the dying summer won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thoughts of life, its purpose and its end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did occupy his mind as he did meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sibyl, by a certain turn of road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For twenty years he had not seen her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it did startle him to meet her now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, too, had changed, and silver locks adorned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her noble forehead, but her eyes were keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And piercing, even as in days of youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she stopped to speak with him, he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their searching glances knew his very soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Long working-day has God ordained for thee”,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, to which he sadly answered thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“My life seems but a transitory dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all its efforts profitless and vain.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“When thou art dust, thy prayer shall be heard,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said a-smiling, and passed on her way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He too moved on, while pondering her words,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark enigma of the prophetess.<br /></span>
<span class="astc">* * * * * * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sibyl’s prophecies we thus have heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their fulfilment now we will relate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which have their place in ages afterwards.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priest as well as prophetess were gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so were generations after them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half hidden by the dread oblivion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prophecy forgotten;&mdash;but a few<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had heard it as an old tradition vague,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fable only, to which none gave heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though twain ash saplings grew from year to year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw at least two generations pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their branches met above the church;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breach also was creeping from the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up through the side-wall’s massive masonry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increasing with the changes of the years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two things which did recall the sibyl’s lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led the people to cut down the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill the rent and hide it from man’s view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again they felt assured that all was well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from the roots new shoots began to grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unmolested through full many years.<br /></span>
<span class="astc">* * * * * * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ages had the river sung its song,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-blending with the church bells’ melody;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be it was the charm of liquid chimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which drew the river closer year by year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But almost imperceptibly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until one spring it overflowed its banks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a rage, fed by the mountain-streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did wear away the distance from the church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forced its course up to the church-yard wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gruesome scene it wrought, as days went by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coffins in the graves began to show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bones in sepulchres of old decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Occasionally came a musty skull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-whirling down the maelstrom of the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now and then a crash and splash was heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When some tall monument did tumble down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its name and praise lost in the seething deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nought can man achieve but it is doomed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, to ruin and oblivion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty trees were undermined and sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loads of earth, their branches ’mid the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like outstreched arms, imploring heav’n for help.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people also lifted hands in prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For night and day they feared the dreadful hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When&mdash;as it seemed&mdash;the church must be destroyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pastor summoned them to spend a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In penitence and supplication true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They came from far and near both old and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, even the sick and crippled folk were brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all might help to lift one prayer to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common prayer from their humble hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through him who knelt upon the altar stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose voice had notes of anguish for his church.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears a penitential psalm was sung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On bended knee; and when again they rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave the place, they passed with downcast heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out through the chancel door, beside the which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old time rent was plainly visible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where again the mountain-ash had reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the roof, and met another’s crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fear they listened to the water’s roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Now only hundred cubits from the church)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the moaning of the chilly wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which bare the rainclouds o’er the naked fields.<br /></span>
<span class="astc">* * * * * * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the midnight hour, and densely dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In torrents fell the rain, the thunder rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lurid lightning gleamed across the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its light revealing nature’s misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one lone woman groping ’mongst the graves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sought the church that she too there might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only one who at the mid-day mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had absent been, for death had kept her home,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband struggling with the last grim foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The struggle being ended, she desired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share in that great prayer of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this she stemmed the terror of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spectral fear of sepulchres and shrine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She found the door unlocked and opened it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She entered, crossed herself, and sought a pew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fervently God’s mercy did implore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then something strange did happen, for behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The church became with dazzling light illumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stranger still, a crowd of people streamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through every door, and without footfall sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A congregation, not of mundane mien,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But glorious in countenance and dress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose utter silence seemed a breath of praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They filled the seats, and by the woman sat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to her touch they were as empty space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the vaults below emerged a band of priests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrayed as in the days when each did serve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the altar of this selfsame church;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All knelt; but one ascended to the Host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged man, whose picture still adorned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gallery, about whose name there clung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The legend of the sibyl’s prophecy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led them in a supplication strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both for the living and the many dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose ashes were imperiled by the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that kind heaven would spare the sacred shrine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Kyrie Eleison sang the flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands outstretched toward burning altar lights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all the ministers exclaimed: Amen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woman felt such wondrous happiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought that she had died and gone to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, all at once she felt assured of this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now she saw her husband, and near him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two little ones, departed years ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She ran with joy to clasp them in her arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they did vanish from her fond embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, all did vanish, even the heavenly lights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she stood there alone in darkness gross;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silence, too, was gone, and now the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which raged in all its fury, took its place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A distant rumbling noise was clearly heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a terror-striking thunder-crash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The church did tremble in its very depths;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woman thought the judgment-day had come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her strength did fail her, and she swooned away.<br /></span>
<span class="astc">* * * * * * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When morning o’er the mountain-tops appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no cloud to hinder its approach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all creation hailed its harbinger:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first faint blushes of the snowcapped peak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raindrops on the grass and upon trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon glittered like innumerable pearls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And diamonds on the bosom of the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hidden chorus in the woods began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its songs of praise for the returning calm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every home the frightened people ’rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hardly dared to speak what most they feared,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The church destroyed&mdash;and timidly the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to behold the ruins of the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when they saw the church still standing there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ran to tell the people and the priest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who came with joy and found it even so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A miracle, it seemed, had taken place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raging flood had wholly disappeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its empty channel bearing witness to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How great and terrible had been its pow’r.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty landslide from the mountain side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had changed its course back to an ancient bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what the people thought the dreadful noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their beloved sanctuary’s fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was of the rushing, rumbling earthen slide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How great was now their joy, when they perceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That God had heard their prayer and spared His house!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With praise the priest across the threshold stepped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many followed gladly after him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To join in common, heartfelt gratitude;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But suddenly an unexpected scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed their souls and filled them with alarm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the altar steps a woman lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stark dead, it seemed, for cold and pale was she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for a moment all did hesitate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To touch her, thinking she was surely dead,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment&mdash;only this, for soon the priest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had ascertained that life was not extinct,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And altar-wine helped to resuscitate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now slowly she emerged from deadly swoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaining consciousness at last could tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why she had come to be in such a place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the things which she had heard and seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of phantom congregation and its mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of priests in strange array before the Host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They marvelled greatly at her narrative,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When said the pastor: “I believe forsooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirits of the dead have worshiped here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined in the prayers of their living friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now a legend, clust’ring ’round the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him whose picture you have pointed out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes to my mind, the sibyl’s prophecy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“When thou art dead, thy prayer shall be heard.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In which the shadows of the shore grow dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly all things into darkness flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon the moon appears and clothes the scene<br /></span>
